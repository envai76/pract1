# pract1

Actually, in the first upload, I tried to use random forest for the answer to question 17, the knit took a very long time, and based on talking with TA (Sheida) and the email from the professor, I just uploaded the .rmd file. After all, I found that training without using any train controller may cause this problem as it goes to train for an unlimited time; I tried to change my code and upload its PDF  file too. Also, I updated my git repo.
